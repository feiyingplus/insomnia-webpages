Set up GitHub authentication and cloud sync. All my (previously local) collections are now in a project named \"Insomnia\" under the workspace \"Personal workspace\".

		"title": "Using Encrypted Cookies instead of Local Storage, IPC Sender Verification, and Preventing Unintended Reloads",
		"body": "### Expected Behavior\n\n1. The app can store sensitive information in encrypted cookies on the user's filesystem.\r\n2. The app can verify all IPC message senders before responding to them.\r\n3. The app can prevent reload of a window when handling navigation to the `appUrl`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. The app uses local storage in an unencrypted manner.\r\n2. The app does not verify `event.sender` on all IPC messages.\r\n3. The app `return`s from `will-navigate` if the navigation is to `appUrl` but does not `preventDefault()`.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nThank you for designing the Insomnia Desktop Application and for making its source code available. The app does a great job of handling in-app navigation and following secure practices. We list a few pointers that can help make the app more secure.\r\n\r\n1. [Encrypting Cookies] The app currently stores sensitive information, including secret key, etc. in local storage. It will be beneficial to use cookies for the same and to encrypt them on the file system using Electron’s fuses. [[Link](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses#cookieencryption)]\r\n2. [IPC Verification] Since the app currently uses custom IPC (e.g., for Socket Handlers [[Ref](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/a5d843171a841b9117e2e4b1503a362fca6bcfd0/packages/insomnia/src/main/network/websocket.ts#L497)]), it may be helpful to integrate sender verification `event.sender` throughout before handling IPC messages in the main process. [[Link](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages)]\r\n3. [Preventing Reloads] The current event handler on ‘will-navigate’ simply returns if the URL matches the `appUrl` [[Ref](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/a5d843171a841b9117e2e4b1503a362fca6bcfd0/packages/insomnia/src/main/window-utils.ts#L106)]. It will be helpful to consider adding an `event.preventDefault()` here as well unless a reload is intended for the window.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n–\r\n\r\nMir Masood Ali, PhD student, University of Illinois Chicago\r\nMohammad Ghasemisharif, PhD Candidate, University of Illinois Chicago\r\nChris Kanich, Associate Professor, University of Illinois Chicago\r\nJason Polakis, Associate Professor, University of Illinois Chicago\r\n\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n8.4.5\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\n12.7.1\n\n### Installation method\n\ndownload from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

		"body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nFor a better user experience, it would be beneficial if the behavior is changed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. At the end of the error message, show the server's response, such as 'UTF-8' header returned by the server is incorrect. This allows users to understand more clearly why Insomnia considers it an error.\r\n2. Instead of treating header parsing failure as an error, display it as a warning and perform a fallback action by automatically detecting and decoding the encoding to UTF-8, then show the response.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nServers often return technically incorrect Content-Encoding headers. The server I'm testing does the same, returning Content-Encoding header with the value UTF-8. Upon further investigation, I found a question on SO that matches my situation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17154967/is-content-encoding-being-set-to-utf-8-invalid\r\n\r\nBoth Chrome web browser and cURL command show the response correctly in such cases. However, Insomnia only shows an error: `Error: Unrecognized or bad HTTP Content or Transfer-Encoding`.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. In Insomnia, you send a GET request to http://openapi.seoul.go.kr:8088/sample/xml/TbAdpWaitAnimalView/1/5/\r\n2. You confirm that an error occurs.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv8.6.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS 14.3.1(23D60)\n\n### Installation method\n\nI can't remember.\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

		"body": "### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI don't expect to Template Tag to run during sync.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI have the 1Password plugin installed to fetch my secrets from the 1Password vault. The plugin is a Template Tag that I used in the Environments. When doing a request the Tag will run and fetch the 1Password secrets before first requesting me to authorise (1Password prompt).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 09 39 48](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/assets/657797/a0aaf107-b9d0-4810-bca6-752b49bc53cc)\r\n\r\nInsomnia does some syncing every minute ([here](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/75c6a94ae99f9cfbbba8da0e817228e75454d03e/packages/insomnia/src/ui/components/dropdowns/sync-dropdown.tsx#L55-L60)). When this sync happens the Template Tag run method is also triggered. That means that when Insomnia is running (even in the background) I will get a 1Password prompt because it tries to fetch the secret in the run method. This is not very handy.\r\n\r\nThe plugin already caches the secret for 1 hour so the prompt only appears once per hour (Insomnia is always running). But getting the prompt every hour is still not plesant.\r\n\r\n**I do wonder why the Template Tag run method is triggered for the sync. And if it can be disabled or prevented. I would think just the content of the Tag needs to be synced and therefor not be run.**\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Install 1Password plugin\r\n2. Use the plugin in the Environments\r\n3. Use the environment in your request\r\n4. Do a request\r\n5. Comply with the 1Password authorisation prompt\r\n6.

Use example.json eg. with the following content:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_type\": \"export\",\r\n  \"__export_format\": 4,\r\n  \"__export_date\": \"2023-07-09T17:27:43.046Z\",\r\n  \"__export_source\": \"insomnia.desktop.app:v2023.4.0\",\r\n  \"resources\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"req_44dcc4a6c60b42b4b91cf8888a2d9b1b\",\r\n      \"parentId\": \"__WORKSPACE_ID__\",\r\n      \"modified\": \"1637671845661\",\r\n      \"created\": 1688992190875,\r\n      \"url\": \"https://google.de\",\r\n      \"name\": \"New Request\",\r\n      \"description\": \"\",\r\n      \"method\": \"GET\",\r\n      \"body\": {},\r\n      \"parameters\": [],\r\n      \"headers\": [],\r\n      \"authentication\": {},\r\n      \"metaSortKey\": -1688992190875,\r\n      \"isPrivate\": false,\r\n      \"settingStoreCookies\": true,\r\n      \"settingSendCookies\": true,\r\n      \"settingDisableRenderRequestBody\": false,\r\n      \"settingEncodeUrl\": true,\r\n      \"settingRebuildPath\": true,\r\n      \"settingFollowRedirects\": \"global\",\r\n      \"_type\": \"request\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"__WORKSPACE_ID__\",\r\n      \"parentId\": null,\r\n      \"modified\": \"1637671845661\",\r\n      \"created\": 1688992188630,\r\n      \"name\": \"My Collection\",\r\n      \"description\": \"\",\r\n      \"scope\": \"collection\",\r\n      \"_type\": \"workspace\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"__BASE_ENVIRONMENT_ID__\",\r\n      \"parentId\": \"__WORKSPACE_ID__\",\r\n      \"modified\": \"1637671845661\",\r\n      \"created\": 1688992188636,\r\n      \"name\": \"Base Environment\",\r\n      \"data\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"https://google.de\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"dataPropertyOrder\": {\r\n        \"&\": [\r\n          \"url\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"color\": null,\r\n      \"isPrivate\": false,\r\n      \"metaSortKey\": 1688992188636,\r\n      \"_type\": \"environment\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Try to import it. The ImportOptions were removed so it is not possible anymore to send a workspaceId. This basically switches the import of workspaces to import of projects and breaks many plugins: #6044\r\n\r\nCredits to @sebastiande for the code snippets for reproduction steps.\r\n\r\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI don't think this should be the expected behaviour, or the documentation should be updated as it leads developers to assume that this behaviour is what was going to happen.\r\nOn my case, I am developing an internal plugin for the company that I work, and this is a blocker that I could not imagine when I was studying what the Insomnia plugins are capable of.\r\nThis was already discussed at #6125, however I don't think that the main issue was understood, since \"sync\" features started being discussed on the thread, even though the discussion was about importing contents of an exported collection/design document on the current workspace.\r\nAlso, I searched on the source code of Insomnia and did not find any occurrence of the string \"ImportOptions\" on the code, which make me think this is a deprecated feature and the documentation is outdated.\r\nIs it correct to assume any of this or is this a known issue that is already under fix from Insomnia team collaborators?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2023.5.5\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\ndownload from insomnia\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Set up GitHub authentication and cloud sync. All my (previously local) collections are now in a project named \"Insomnia\" under the workspace \"Personal workspace\". The project type is shown as \"Secure Cloud\" in the project settings.\r\n\r\nOn my other Mac or Windows machines, I see multiple copies of the \"Insomnia\" project, but none have any contents.\r\n\r\nAttempts to change the project name (to see if syncing is working at all) aren't reflected on other computers.\r\n\r\nI next manually exported the collections for that project to a JSON file and transferred them to the new machine. I created a new project on that machine and imported the collections (which worked). All machines see the new project, but it still appears empty.\r\n\r\nThe dashboard on the Insomnia website shows 11 projects, 29 files and 1 collaborator, but when logging in on my other Mac, I see the 11 projects, but none contain any files.\r\n\r\nI have tried deleting the contents of the `~/Application Support/Insomnia` folder, and neither of the logs in the `~/Logs/Insomnia` folder show any errors.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nAs far as I can tell, there's no way to trigger a sync inside the UI itself, so I have no idea if a sync is being performed (I've been restarting Insomnia to try to trigger a forced download). It would be really helpful to see some visual indication that syncing has been performed, and a \"Sync now\" or \"Refresh\" function somewhere to trigger an attempted cloud sync.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n8.4.2\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Sonoma 14.1.1 (23B81) and Windows 11 v22H2 (Build 22621.2428)\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload from Insomnia.rest website\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nAs far as I can tell, cloud sync has never worked properly for me.",

	"### Expected Behavior\n\n1. The app can store sensitive information in encrypted cookies on the user's filesystem.\r\n2. The app can verify all IPC message senders before responding to them.\r\n3. The app can prevent reload of a window when handling navigation to the `appUrl`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. The app uses local storage in an unencrypted manner.\r\n2. The app does not verify `event.sender` on all IPC messages.\r\n3. The app `return`s from `will-navigate` if the navigation is to `appUrl` but does not `preventDefault()`.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nThank you for designing the Insomnia Desktop Application and for making its source code available. The app does a great job of handling in-app navigation and following secure practices. We list a few pointers that can help make the app more secure.\r\n\r\n1. [Encrypting Cookies] The app currently stores sensitive information, including secret key, etc. in local storage. It will be beneficial to use cookies for the same and to encrypt them on the file system using Electron’s fuses. [[Link](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses#cookieencryption)]\r\n2. [IPC Verification] Since the app currently uses custom IPC (e.g., for Socket Handlers [[Ref](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/a5d843171a841b9117e2e4b1503a362fca6bcfd0/packages/insomnia/src/main/network/websocket.ts#L497)]), it may be helpful to integrate sender verification `event.sender` throughout before handling IPC messages in the main process. [[Link](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages)]\r\n3. [Preventing Reloads] The current event handler on ‘will-navigate’ simply returns if the URL matches the `appUrl` [[Ref](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/a5d843171a841b9117e2e4b1503a362fca6bcfd0/packages/insomnia/src/main/window-utils.ts#L106)].

So I like to keep the list in the left panel somewhat filtered down permanently depending on what I need to see - because otherwise there is a general performance impact due to it having to display so many items in the list all the time.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for the meantime whenever this happens is to simply type an extra character into the filter field then delete that character, triggering the filter to reapply as a result of changed input.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n8.6.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Sonoma 14.3.1 (23D60)\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownloaded from official insomnia.rest website\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

	"Unable to View Response When Server Returns Incorrect Content-Encoding Header",
	"### Expected Behavior\n\nFor a better user experience, it would be beneficial if the behavior is changed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. At the end of the error message, show the server's response, such as 'UTF-8' header returned by the server is incorrect. This allows users to understand more clearly why Insomnia considers it an error.\r\n2. Instead of treating header parsing failure as an error, display it as a warning and perform a fallback action by automatically detecting and decoding the encoding to UTF-8, then show the response.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nServers often return technically incorrect Content-Encoding headers. The server I'm testing does the same, returning Content-Encoding header with the value UTF-8. Upon further investigation, I found a question on SO that matches my situation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17154967/is-content-encoding-being-set-to-utf-8-invalid\r\n\r\nBoth Chrome web browser and cURL command show the response correctly in such cases. However, Insomnia only shows an error: `Error: Unrecognized or bad HTTP Content or Transfer-Encoding`.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. In Insomnia, you send a GET request to http://openapi.seoul.go.kr:8088/sample/xml/TbAdpWaitAnimalView/1/5/\r\n2. You confirm that an error occurs.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv8.6.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS 14.3.1(23D60)\n\n### Installation method\n\nI can't remember.\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

	"### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI don't expect to Template Tag to run during sync.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI have the 1Password plugin installed to fetch my secrets from the 1Password vault. The plugin is a Template Tag that I used in the Environments. When doing a request the Tag will run and fetch the 1Password secrets before first requesting me to authorise (1Password prompt).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 09 39 48](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/assets/657797/a0aaf107-b9d0-4810-bca6-752b49bc53cc)\r\n\r\nInsomnia does some syncing every minute ([here](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/75c6a94ae99f9cfbbba8da0e817228e75454d03e/packages/insomnia/src/ui/components/dropdowns/sync-dropdown.tsx#L55-L60)). When this sync happens the Template Tag run method is also triggered. That means that when Insomnia is running (even in the background) I will get a 1Password prompt because it tries to fetch the secret in the run method. This is not very handy.\r\n\r\nThe plugin already caches the secret for 1 hour so the prompt only appears once per hour (Insomnia is always running). But getting the prompt every hour is still not plesant.\r\n\r\n**I do wonder why the Template Tag run method is triggered for the sync. And if it can be disabled or prevented. I would think just the content of the Tag needs to be synced and therefor not be run.**\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Install 1Password plugin\r\n2. Use the plugin in the Environments\r\n3. Use the environment in your request\r\n4. Do a request\r\n5. Comply with the 1Password authorisation prompt\r\n6.

	"### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFollowing [the documentation](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/context-object-reference#contextdata), data context import function can receive an argument of type ImportOptions, which has an id corresponding to the workspace that the import should be executed at.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nEven if I pass a valid workspaceId on the ImportOptions argument, the import occurs, but it creates a new workspace instead of importing the contents on the actual workspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a plugin with minimal code in index.js eg:\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports.workspaceActions = [\r\n    {\r\n        label: 'Pull from GIT',\r\n        icon: 'fa-arrow-down',\r\n        action: async (context, data) => {\r\n            const impFilename = 'example.json';\r\n            if (!fs.existsSync(impFilename)) {\r\n                context.app.alert('Error importing',\r\n                    'Seems example.json is not existing!');\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            fs.readFile(impFilename, \"utf8\", function (err, fileContent) {\r\n                context.data.import.raw(fileContent, {\r\n                    workspaceId: data.workspace._id,\r\n                });\r\n            });\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n2. Use example.json eg. with the following content:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"_type\": \"export\",\r\n  \"__export_format\": 4,\r\n  \"__export_date\": \"2023-07-09T17:27:43.046Z\",\r\n  \"__export_source\": \"insomnia.desktop.app:v2023.4.0\",\r\n  \"resources\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"req_44dcc4a6c60b42b4b91cf8888a2d9b1b\",\r\n      \"parentId\": \"__WORKSPACE_ID__\",\r\n      \"modified\": \"1637671845661\",\r\n      \"created\": 1688992190875,\r\n      \"url\": \"https://google.de\",\r\n      \"name\": \"New Request\",\r\n      \"description\": \"\",\r\n      \"method\": \"GET\",\r\n      \"body\": {},\r\n      \"parameters\": [],\r\n      \"headers\": [],\r\n      \"authentication\": {},\r\n      \"metaSortKey\": -1688992190875,\r\n      \"isPrivate\": false,\r\n      \"settingStoreCookies\": true,\r\n      \"settingSendCookies\": true,\r\n      \"settingDisableRenderRequestBody\": false,\r\n      \"settingEncodeUrl\": true,\r\n      \"settingRebuildPath\": true,\r\n      \"settingFollowRedirects\": \"global\",\r\n      \"_type\": \"request\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"__WORKSPACE_ID__\",\r\n      \"parentId\": null,\r\n      \"modified\": \"1637671845661\",\r\n      \"created\": 1688992188630,\r\n      \"name\": \"My Collection\",\r\n      \"description\": \"\",\r\n      \"scope\": \"collection\",\r\n      \"_type\": \"workspace\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"__BASE_ENVIRONMENT_ID__\",\r\n      \"parentId\": \"__WORKSPACE_ID__\",\r\n      \"modified\": \"1637671845661\",\r\n      \"created\": 1688992188636,\r\n      \"name\": \"Base Environment\",\r\n      \"data\": {\r\n        \"url\": \"https://google.de\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"dataPropertyOrder\": {\r\n        \"&\": [\r\n          \"url\"\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      \"color\": null,\r\n      \"isPrivate\": false,\r\n      \"metaSortKey\": 1688992188636,\r\n      \"_type\": \"environment\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Try to import it. The ImportOptions were removed so it is not possible anymore to send a workspaceId. This basically switches the import of workspaces to import of projects and breaks many plugins: #6044\r\n\r\nCredits to @sebastiande for the code snippets for reproduction steps.\r\n\r\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI don't think this should be the expected behaviour, or the documentation should be updated as it leads developers to assume that this behaviour is what was going to happen.\r\nOn my case, I am developing an internal plugin for the company that I work, and this is a blocker that I could not imagine when I was studying what the Insomnia plugins are capable of.\r\nThis was already discussed at #6125, however I don't think that the main issue was understood, since \"sync\" features started being discussed on the thread, even though the discussion was about importing contents of an exported collection/design document on the current workspace.\r\nAlso, I searched on the source code of Insomnia and did not find any occurrence of the string \"ImportOptions\" on the code, which make me think this is a deprecated feature and the documentation is outdated.\r\nIs it correct to assume any of this or is this a known issue that is already under fix from Insomnia team collaborators?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2023.5.5\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows 11 Pro\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\ndownload from insomnia\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",
