When running `inso lint spec somespec.yaml`, it is indicated in the console that the Spectral YAML is being loaded. However, this does not occur when linting with `inso lint spec --exportFile some-exportfile.json \"Some API Spec identifier here`\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe Inso CLI does not use the .spectral.yaml file in the current working directory when the `--exportFile` flag is used to define an Insomnia v4 export file (Design Document).\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Export a design document containing an API specification.\r\n2. Create a `.spectral.yml` file and add custom rulesets.\r\n3. Lint the API spec within the export file using `inso lint spec --exportFile export.json \"API Spec identifier\"`.\r\n4.

I then updated to 10.3.0 (was at 9.* before) and also the current beta, same behaviour.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [X] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.552] [info]  Running version 10.3.1-beta.0\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.554] [info]  [electron client protocol] successfully set default protocol 'insomnia://'\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.658] [info]  [fix] Running database repairs\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.916] [info]  [db] Initialized DB at /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Insomnia/insomnia.$TYPE.db\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.916] [info]  [db] Init responses DB\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.917] [info]  [db] Init websocket-responses DB\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.917] [info]  [localstorage] Initialized at /Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Insomnia/localStorage\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.936] [info]  [main] Loading file:///Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/index.html\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.942] [info]  [main] Registering the hidden window restarting handler\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.943] [info]  [updater] Using url https://updates.insomnia.rest/builds/check/mac?v=10.3.1-beta.0&app=com.insomnia.app&channel=stable\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.943] [info]  [updater] Checking for updates url=https://updates.insomnia.rest/builds/check/mac?v=10.3.1-beta.0&app=com.insomnia.app&channel=stable\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:10.989] [info]  [main] window focus\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:11.409] [info]  [updater] Not Available\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:28.240] [info]  [main] window blur\r\n[2025-01-13 16:47:28.240] [error] Error sending from webFrameMain:  Error: Render frame was disposed before WebFrameMain could be accessed\r\n    at s.send (node:electron/js2c/browser_init:2:89692)\r\n    at _.send (node:electron/js2c/browser_init:2:74140)\r\n    at BrowserWindow.<anonymous> (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/main.min.js:86858:35)\r\n    at BrowserWindow.emit (node:events:531:35)\r\n    at emitter.emit (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/main.min.js:82404:14)\r\n[2025-01-13 16:48:09.958] [info]  [main] window focus\r\n[2025-01-13 16:48:09.959] [error] Error sending from webFrameMain:  Error: Render frame was disposed before WebFrameMain could be accessed\r\n    at s.send (node:electron/js2c/browser_init:2:89692)\r\n    at _.send (node:electron/js2c/browser_init:2:74140)\r\n    at BrowserWindow.<anonymous> (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/main.min.js:86854:35)\r\n    at BrowserWindow.emit (node:events:531:35)\r\n    at emitter.emit (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/main.min.js:82404:14)\r\n[2025-01-13 16:48:14.396] [info]  [main] window blur\r\n[2025-01-13 16:48:14.397] [error] Error sending from webFrameMain:  Error: Render frame was disposed before WebFrameMain could be accessed\r\n    at s.send (node:electron/js2c/browser_init:2:89692)\r\n    at _.send (node:electron/js2c/browser_init:2:74140)\r\n    at BrowserWindow.<anonymous> (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/main.min.js:86858:35)\r\n    at BrowserWindow.emit (node:events:531:35)\r\n    at emitter.emit (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/main.min.js:82404:14)\r\n\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n10.3.0, 10.3.1-beta\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nMacBook - Apple M2 Pro\n\n### Installation method\n\nhomebrew and via dmg from github releases\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n9.* something, I am not sure exactly - but it was not working after the import of the jira request collection",

But unfortunately, requests use the stale (previous) OAuth 2.0 Token after clearing OAuth 2 session and clearing and retrieving a new token with a different account. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI am using Insomnia in scratch pad mode. I have a folder set up with OAuth 2.0 authentication. The requests inside the folder are set to inherit auth from parent. Unfortunately, when the parent folder has a new account authenticated, the underlying requests never use the new account. \n\nI've tried \"Clear OAuth 2 session\" as well as \"Clear\" and \"Refresh Token\" on the OAuth 2 tab. I've also tried all of these after rebooting the application. The requests will continue to use the old account even though the new JWT access token on the OAuth 2 tab on the folder clearly shows that new account that it should be using. \n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. In Scratch Pad mode, create a folder with OAuth 2.0 authentication with at least one request in it. \n2. Authenticate with an account and run your request, checking that the account is the correct one. \n3. Go back and login with a different account at the folder level. \n4.

Meanwhile, Insomnia either halts at this iteration, continuously incrementing the execution time as if awaiting a prolonged server response, or displays an error dialog, as depicted in the screenshot provided below.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57741f01-12a0-4d3c-a47b-a3a81ca942aa)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nTo reproduce the issue, it is sufficient to create a minimal FastAPI server where a function accepts a file and simply returns a response and send multiple requests to it in a loop.\n```python\nimport uvicorn\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"/uploadfile/\")\nasync def upload_handler(file: UploadFile):\n    return {\"filename\": file.filename}\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(\"main:app\", host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000, reload=False)\n```\n\nAs I said, file in the requests body must be in Multipart/form-data format.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nNotably, Insomnia does not freeze when sending a single request or when sending requests in a loop to the correct path that does not trigger a redirect. However, in such cases, the error dialog mentioned earlier appears upon completion of the loop. Additionally, I have confirmed that the server is functioning correctly and the issue does not originate from its side, as identical operations in Postman execute seamlessly without any problems.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n10.3.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11 LTSC 2H24\n\n### Installation method\n\ndownloaded from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

Disable `Follow redirects` in Insomnia preferences\n2. Visit a site that returns a 307 response with a `location` header of a different domain and a `set-cookie` header without a `domain` attribute (my test endpoints do not include a `domain` attribute in the cookie response so maybe that is related, I have not tested when a `domain` is included)\n3. Observe that cookie in insomnia is linked to the domain in the `location` header instead of the original requested domain, which returned the `set-cookie` header\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nWhen `Follow redirects` is enabled the cookie is set correctly on the original domain.\n\nThis is somewhat similar to https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/6478 but that is about when `Follow redirects` is enabled and a cookie is set by the _second_ domain. This is about when `Follow redirects` is _disabled_ and the _original_ domain attempts to set a cookie.\n\nOriginally found issue on version 2023.5.8 of Insomnia, upgraded to 10.3.1 hoping it was fixed, but it is not.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n10.3.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11 Version 22H2\n\n### Installation method\n\ndownload from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

Prepare a mock API endpoint that returns the following JSON response (or configure your backend to return it):\n\n```json\n{\n    \"values\": [\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 99999999999999.99,\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 999999999999999.99,\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n_(This can be done using tools like json-server, mockoon, or a real backend endpoint.)_\n\n2. Send a GET/POST request to this endpoint using Insomnia v11.0.0.\n\n3. Observe the response in Insomnia:    \n    - The first amount (`99999999999999.99`) may display as `99999999999999.98`.\n    - The second amount (`999999999999999.99`) may display as `1000000000000000` (losing the decimal part). \n    \n4. Compare with other tools:\n    - Verify the same request in Insomnia v2023.4.0., curl, or Postman to confirm the correct values are returned.\n\n\n### _Root Cause:_\n\n### _Likely related to:_\n\n- JavaScript’s number precision limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 2^53 - 1).\n- New JSON parser in Insomnia v11 mishandling large floats.\n\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv11.0.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.3.2 \n\n### Installation method\n\ndownload from insomnia\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nv2023.4.0.",

		"body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nA multipart response should be displayed, with each part showing on the Select Part Dropdown.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIf the multipart response's boundary has uppercase letters in it, the viewer will give this error: Failed to parse multipart response: stream ended unexpectedly.\n\nIf I make a custom plugin to fix the casing issue of the boundary, I still have a problem with the Select Part Dropdown in cases where the response parts don't have name/filename properties.  There's no default name in the component, so it populates with blanks which then get collapsed into one option.  So you can't select anything past part 1.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5023a5ba-22b0-43b3-a2c3-376c93e2dc5f)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nSubmit a request to an API that returns a multipart response.  In my case it's a soap service that returns a multipart/related response that can have one or more parts.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [ ] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI think the issue with the content type casing is in response-viewer.tsx where the ResponseMultipartViewer is returned using the contentType variable for the parameter.  That variable is lower-cased by default.  I think it should have been using originalContentType instead.\n\nFor the Select Part Dropdown, the selected item and list item text just needs a fallback if the part title is null.  Like: {selectedPart.title || `Part ${selectedPart.id + 1}`}\n\nI tested both of those fixes locally and it seems to work fine.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n11.0.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

		"body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nOnly the selected request and its direct dependencies should be included in the exported file. Unrelated folders and their documentation should be excluded, especially when exporting a single request.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter the fix in [#8505](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/8505), exporting a single request as “Insomnia v5” no longer includes the entire workspace, which is great. However, the export still contains the names of all folders and the content from their “docs” fields, even if those folders are unrelated to the request being exported.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n\t1.\tCreate a workspace with multiple folders and several requests.\n\t2.\tAdd documentation (in the “docs” tab) to multiple folders.\n\t3.\tSelect a single request to export (via Export > Selected requests > Insomnia v5).\n\t4.\tOpen the generated .json file.\n\t5.\tObserve that the export still includes unrelated folder names and all “docs” content from those folders.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nHi Insomnia team! First of all, thank you so much for the recent fix in [#8505](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/8505) — the reduced file size when exporting individual requests is already a great improvement, and I really appreciate your responsiveness and support.\n\nI just wanted to share a small follow-up issue related to that fix. When exporting a single request, the resulting file still includes the names of all folders/directories, along with the “docs” content from them.\n\nIn my case, I use the “docs” section frequently to document internal details, headers, or ideas — so these additional entries end up exposing more information than necessary, even when I only want to export a specific request.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n11.0.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows_NT x64 10.0.22631\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload + autoupdate\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

This resulting in failed tests  with error: 'failed to find workspace' and test require update with new request id\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Go to Export project option for a project with unit tests where request id is used while sending a request (e.g. const response = await insomnia.send('req_eeb4e85ca9494caeb4b38ab1b4a54c9e') ..)\r\n2. Export as JSON file\r\n3. As other user use Import option\r\n4. 'Choose a File for import' option\r\n5. Import previously exported JSON file\r\n6.

	"Requests use stale OAuth 2.0 Token after clearing OAuth 2 session",
	"### Expected Behavior\n\nIf I change accounts when using OAuth 2.0 authentication, I expect all of the requests in that folder to use the new account. But unfortunately, requests use the stale (previous) OAuth 2.0 Token after clearing OAuth 2 session and clearing and retrieving a new token with a different account. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI am using Insomnia in scratch pad mode. I have a folder set up with OAuth 2.0 authentication. The requests inside the folder are set to inherit auth from parent. Unfortunately, when the parent folder has a new account authenticated, the underlying requests never use the new account. \n\nI've tried \"Clear OAuth 2 session\" as well as \"Clear\" and \"Refresh Token\" on the OAuth 2 tab. I've also tried all of these after rebooting the application. The requests will continue to use the old account even though the new JWT access token on the OAuth 2 tab on the folder clearly shows that new account that it should be using. \n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. In Scratch Pad mode, create a folder with OAuth 2.0 authentication with at least one request in it. \n2. Authenticate with an account and run your request, checking that the account is the correct one. \n3. Go back and login with a different account at the folder level. \n4.

	"### Expected Behavior\n\nA POST request containing a file in its body, formatted as multipart/form-data, is sent to the FastAPI server in a loop exceeding 100 iterations. The server, adhering to its default configuration, issues a redirect with a 307 status code to the same path, albeit without a trailing slash. Following this redirect, the request is expected to be successfully processed and returned.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen executed in a loop, after approximately 20–25 iterations, the server issues a redirect with a 307 status code; however, it ceases to receive any further requests from Insomnia. Meanwhile, Insomnia either halts at this iteration, continuously incrementing the execution time as if awaiting a prolonged server response, or displays an error dialog, as depicted in the screenshot provided below.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57741f01-12a0-4d3c-a47b-a3a81ca942aa)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nTo reproduce the issue, it is sufficient to create a minimal FastAPI server where a function accepts a file and simply returns a response and send multiple requests to it in a loop.\n```python\nimport uvicorn\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"/uploadfile/\")\nasync def upload_handler(file: UploadFile):\n    return {\"filename\": file.filename}\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(\"main:app\", host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000, reload=False)\n```\n\nAs I said, file in the requests body must be in Multipart/form-data format.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nNotably, Insomnia does not freeze when sending a single request or when sending requests in a loop to the correct path that does not trigger a redirect. However, in such cases, the error dialog mentioned earlier appears upon completion of the loop. Additionally, I have confirmed that the server is functioning correctly and the issue does not originate from its side, as identical operations in Postman execute seamlessly without any problems.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n10.3.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11 LTSC 2H24\n\n### Installation method\n\ndownloaded from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

Disable `Follow redirects` in Insomnia preferences\n2. Visit a site that returns a 307 response with a `location` header of a different domain and a `set-cookie` header without a `domain` attribute (my test endpoints do not include a `domain` attribute in the cookie response so maybe that is related, I have not tested when a `domain` is included)\n3.

	"## Expected Behavior\n\n### **Description:**\n\nWhen receiving a JSON response containing large floating-point numbers (e.g., 99999999999999.99), Insomnia v11.0.0 modifies the values in two ways:\n\n### **Incorrect Rounding:**\n\n`99999999999999.99` → Rounds to `99999999999999.98` (precision error)\n\n### **Dropping Decimal Part:**\n\n`999999999999999.99` → Truncates to `1000000000000000` (decimal places lost completely)\nThis issue did not occur in previous versions of Insomnia (e.g., v2023.4.0.).\n\n\n### **Expected Result (Correct Values):**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"values\": [\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 99999999999999.99,  // Exact value\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 999999999999999.99,  // Exact value (no truncation)\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n### **Actual Result (Bug Manifestations):**\n\n#### **Case 1: Incorrect Rounding**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"sum\": {\n        \"amount\": 99999999999999.98,  // Rounded down incorrectly\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Case 2: Decimal Part Dropped**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"sum\": {\n        \"amount\": 1000000000000000,  // Decimal part (.99) removed\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Prepare a mock API endpoint that returns the following JSON response (or configure your backend to return it):\n\n```json\n{\n    \"values\": [\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 99999999999999.99,\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 999999999999999.99,\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n_(This can be done using tools like json-server, mockoon, or a real backend endpoint.)_\n\n2. Send a GET/POST request to this endpoint using Insomnia v11.0.0.\n\n3. Observe the response in Insomnia:    \n    - The first amount (`99999999999999.99`) may display as `99999999999999.98`.\n    - The second amount (`999999999999999.99`) may display as `1000000000000000` (losing the decimal part). \n    \n4. Compare with other tools:\n    - Verify the same request in Insomnia v2023.4.0., curl, or Postman to confirm the correct values are returned.\n\n\n### _Root Cause:_\n\n### _Likely related to:_\n\n- JavaScript’s number precision limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 2^53 - 1).\n- New JSON parser in Insomnia v11 mishandling large floats.\n\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv11.0.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.3.2 \n\n### Installation method\n\ndownload from insomnia\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nv2023.4.0.",

	"Multipart Viewer isn't displaying responses when boundary has uppercase letters and/or parts with no names",
	"### Expected Behavior\n\nA multipart response should be displayed, with each part showing on the Select Part Dropdown.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nIf the multipart response's boundary has uppercase letters in it, the viewer will give this error: Failed to parse multipart response: stream ended unexpectedly.\n\nIf I make a custom plugin to fix the casing issue of the boundary, I still have a problem with the Select Part Dropdown in cases where the response parts don't have name/filename properties.  There's no default name in the component, so it populates with blanks which then get collapsed into one option.  So you can't select anything past part 1.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5023a5ba-22b0-43b3-a2c3-376c93e2dc5f)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nSubmit a request to an API that returns a multipart response.  In my case it's a soap service that returns a multipart/related response that can have one or more parts.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [ ] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI think the issue with the content type casing is in response-viewer.tsx where the ResponseMultipartViewer is returned using the contentType variable for the parameter.  That variable is lower-cased by default.  I think it should have been using originalContentType instead.\n\nFor the Select Part Dropdown, the selected item and list item text just needs a fallback if the part title is null.  Like: {selectedPart.title || `Part ${selectedPart.id + 1}`}\n\nI tested both of those fixes locally and it seems to work fine.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n11.0.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

	"### Expected Behavior\n\nOnly the selected request and its direct dependencies should be included in the exported file. Unrelated folders and their documentation should be excluded, especially when exporting a single request.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nAfter the fix in [#8505](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/8505), exporting a single request as “Insomnia v5” no longer includes the entire workspace, which is great. However, the export still contains the names of all folders and the content from their “docs” fields, even if those folders are unrelated to the request being exported.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n\t1.\tCreate a workspace with multiple folders and several requests.\n\t2.\tAdd documentation (in the “docs” tab) to multiple folders.\n\t3.\tSelect a single request to export (via Export > Selected requests > Insomnia v5).\n\t4.\tOpen the generated .json file.\n\t5.\tObserve that the export still includes unrelated folder names and all “docs” content from those folders.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nHi Insomnia team! First of all, thank you so much for the recent fix in [#8505](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/8505) — the reduced file size when exporting individual requests is already a great improvement, and I really appreciate your responsiveness and support.\n\nI just wanted to share a small follow-up issue related to that fix. When exporting a single request, the resulting file still includes the names of all folders/directories, along with the “docs” content from them.\n\nIn my case, I use the “docs” section frequently to document internal details, headers, or ideas — so these additional entries end up exposing more information than necessary, even when I only want to export a specific request.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n11.0.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows_NT x64 10.0.22631\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload + autoupdate\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

	"Import bugs when request has a file",
	"### Expected Behavior\n\nMake a collection., and a Request, with a body type of \"Multipart FormData\". Add a part/field which must be a type of \"File\" and add a file to it.\n\nAfter that, export it to \"Insomnia v5\" yaml file.\nThen import it again.\n\nExpected behaviour: Import will work.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nImport doesnt work.\nI get error: No importers found for file.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Make a collection.,\n2. Add a request\n3. Set the body type to \"Multipart FormData\". \n4. Add a part/field which must be a type of \"File\"\n5. Add a file to the part/field.\n6. Export the collection to Insomnia v5 yaml file\n7. Import the collection. You will now get error: No importers found for file.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [ ] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI have found a very specific way for this to work. If i make a request, and then body \"FormData\" and then add a part which must be field, then just put in the key and value (text), and then right after you put in the text in the key and value, then change to file, and then the file will actually work.\n\nNEW UPDATE BUG\nI have also found out if you maek a field/part, and only put the key in without any value, it will also bug the same way\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n11.0.2\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows_NT x64 10.0.19045\n\n### Installation method\n\nFrom website for windows\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",
