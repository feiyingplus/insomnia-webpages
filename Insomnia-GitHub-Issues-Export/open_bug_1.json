In particular, it appears like some kind of rounding in the order of ~15 ms is performed, and additionally that the response time is missing altogether sometimes (which may or may not be related).\r\n\r\nMy observations are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) When pinging the server, the roundtrip to the server is stable at 11-12 ms, with the occasional arbitrarily slower result. This seems reasonable.\r\n\r\n2) When repeatedly calling the endpoint through Chrome, the response time is stable around 16-17 ms, with the occasional arbitrarily slower result. This also seems reasonable, considering the additional overhead of HTTPS, the webserver, the API code, ...\r\n\r\n3) When repeatedly calling the endpoint through Insomnia, the response time is stable around 15-16 ms, but occasionally is either **0 ms** or **31 ms**. Never 1-14 ms, and never 17-30 ms. This does not seem reasonable. **0 ms** should be impossible given the 11-12 ms roundtrip to the server. Considering the **31 ms** results as well, it seems like there is some kind of rounding in the order of ~15 ms going on.",

Create a simple request that creates user, and returns the UUID of the new user:\r\n```\r\nPOST {{ base_url }}/users\r\n{\r\n  \"Name\": \"John\",\r\n  \"Surname\": \"Doe\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2.

Go to the TEST tab and setup a test suite that will first create a user, and then retrieve it\r\n5.

It was less, about 20-40 seconds before, now it's really hard to use.\r\n\r\nWhen I hit \"Send\" button, \"Loading\" title appears for about a second, then time count starts and Insomnia goes idle.\r\n\r\nDuring this idle period:\r\n- Insomnia ignores the \"Cancel\" button, therefore request cannot be canceled.\r\n- Other menus are available (for example, \"Preferences\", \"Manage Environments\")\r\n- Insomnia process starts to require 15-40% CPU, doing seemingly nothing. (Intel Core i5-4690K)\r\n- Application, which is supposed to receive the request, registers nothing coming. (Unlike insomnia, browser receive responses immediately for same endpoints)\r\n\r\nAfter the request is done:\r\n- From the moment it actually \"happens\", everything is ok.\r\n- Insomnia shows timing (next to request status) not including the \"Idle\" period, several milliseconds.\r\n- In \"Timeline\" tab, in \"Current time is \" statement, it shows time after the idle period passed.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

		"body": "<!--\r\nThank you for filing a bug report! 🐛 Please provide a short summary of the bug,\r\nalong with any information you feel relevant to replicating the bug.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot produce a minimal reproduction case (something that would work in\r\nisolation), please provide the steps or even link to a repository that causes\r\nthe problematic output to occur. \r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using Environment Variables, functions/tags inside a nested block referring to another Environment Variable that is constructed from an environment variable do not use the calculated variable value; instead the literal string is used. This only seems to impact functions, as direct references to these variables seem to still work.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to Base Environments\r\n1. Use this environment config:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"first_name\": \"Bobby\",\r\n  \"last_name\": \"'; DROP TABLES;'\",\r\n  \"full_name\": \"{{ _.first_name }} {{ _.last_name }}\",\r\n  \"baseEncodedRoot\": \"{% base64 'encode', 'normal', _.full_name %}\",\r\n  \"sub\": {\r\n    \"baseEncodedSub\": \"{% base64 'encode', 'normal', _.full_name %}\",\r\n    \"full_name\": \"{{_.full_name}}\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1. Mouse over both `_.baseEncodedRoot` and `_.sub.baseEncodedSub` tags and notice that they are both listed as having the same value.\r\n1. Click Done to exit the Manage Environments\r\n1. Create a new request\r\n1. Add two parameters:\r\n  * base64EncodedRootName={{ _.baseEncodedRoot }}\r\n  * base64EncodedSubName={{ _.sub.baseEncodedSub }}\r\n1. Click to preview/execute request\r\n1. Notice the values in the parameters are different\r\n1. Notice if you decode the base64 values, the root value is the calculated value (i.e., `Bobby '; DROP TABLES;'`; CORRECT), whereas the sub value is the literal string of the referenced value (i.e., `{{ _.first_name }} {{ _.last_name }}`; INCORRECT)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUsage of a tag/function that refers to another variable that is constructed from other variables should be the same whether it is on the root or nested in a block.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129673212-cde28656-9dd6-47bb-b074-e4c171878050.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129673289-fd1d6663-a559-4c2d-aebb-a0290047ab99.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129672830-69410a6b-a79c-46ac-999f-d9f30c0b6774.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. macOS 10.15.1]\r\n - Installation Method: [homebrew, built from source]\r\n - App Version: Insomnia 2021.4.1\r\nRelease date: 7/6/2021\r\nOS: Darwin x64 19.6.0\r\nElectron: 9.3.5\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nV8: 8.3.110.13-electron.0\r\nArchitecture: x64\r\nnode-libcurl: libcurl/7.73.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1k zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.9 zstd/1.4.9 libidn2/2.1.1 libssh2/1.9.0 nghttp2/1.42.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis was first discovered while using the Default Headers plugin to construct a header. After digging into things, I realized it wasn't an issue with the default headers plugin but has to do with the way the variables are being rendered outside the Manage Environments section.\r\n",

		"title": "[WORKAROUND] Export/import is implemented as backup/restore and causes loss of data",
		"body": "### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks the _Import from File_ button that is placed contextually in an empty collection, or, likewise, when the user navigates to a collection _Import/Export_ menu selection and selects _Import Data / From File_, this implies that data will be imported into the collection in the current context.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while importing, it's reasonable to expect that Insomnia would warn the user that the data being imported may overwrite parts of the existing collection and whether the user wants to do that, leave new data alone or just abort the import and sort it out manually before attempting another import.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe import functionality in most applications out there implies that some external data will be brought into the application or a different application area and adapted for the importing application or that area. \r\n\r\nInsomnia implements Export/Import as if it's a Backup/Restore and ignores contextually-placed import buttons and menus and uses various identifiers saved in the imported file to read data into the original collection. So, from the context, it appears that even though the pop-up said import was successful, nothing was imported.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, Insomnia reads data into the original collection without any regard to any modifications of that collection and silently wipes out existing data. Given that Insomnia follows the new trend of eliminating explicit load/save functionality, there is absolutely no way to preserve that lost data. It's just gone.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n* Create a test request collection `ABC`. Don't use any actual collections.\r\n* Add a couple of requests.\r\n* Export `ABC` as v4 YAML.\r\n* Rename `ABC` to `XYZ` in collection settings and edit collection description.\r\n* Create an empty collection `EMPTY`\r\n* Within `EMPTY`, click _Import from File_ and select exported YAML for `ABC`.\r\n* A pop-up is presented that the file was imported successfully and gives some stats.\r\n* The collection `EMPTY` remains empty, as if the import fails.\r\n* Switch to the dashboard.\r\n* `XYZ` was reverted to `ABC` by import and the new description and all request modifications are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThere's a recent issue for this and I apologize for creating this one, but I wanted to provide more context. If you want to close this one as a duplicate, I understand. Here it is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/4246\r\n\r\nThis issue was created as a result of this discussion with @develohpanda:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/4034#issuecomment-988302605\r\n\r\nThe least Insomnia can do is to compare time stamps and warn the user that the collection that is being restored from exported data has been modified after it was exported. This won't cost much development, but will give people a chance to learn that their data is about to be overwritten.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to keep current functionality, I suggest to rename it to Backup/Restore because it doesn't have much to do with Export/Import. If you choose to keep Export/Import, which would be desirable, imported data should be adapted for the collection into which it is being imported. This should include importing into other areas, such as importing into the Debug collection of a design document.\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2021.6.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Pro Version\t21H2 build 19044.1387\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nwebsite download\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",

		"body": "### Expected Behavior\n\ncurl command to include `;type=application/json` for metadata part\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `;type=application/json` is missing and generated curl does not send a valid request.\r\nThe server responds:\r\n> Resolved [org.springframework.web.HttpMediaTypeNotSupportedException: Content type 'application/octet-stream' not supported]\r\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n0. Consider the following simple http handler (since I am a Java developer, the example is based on Spring Boot), the `App.groovy`:\r\n```groovy\r\nimport groovy.transform.ToString\r\nimport org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile;\r\n\r\n@RestController\r\nclass WebApplication {\r\n    @PostMapping(path = \"/upload-file\", consumes = \"multipart/form-data\")\r\n    String home(@RequestPart MultipartFile file, @RequestPart FileUploadMetadata metadata) {\r\n        println(metadata)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@ToString\r\nclass FileUploadMetadata {\r\n    String description\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt expects multipart POST request of 2 parts:\r\n- the `file` itself\r\n- and some json-formatted `metadata` with `description` field (as an example)\r\n\r\n1. run the server app with `spring run App.groovy`. PS the easiest way to get `spring` command is to install [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) and then install both Java and Spring Boot: `sdk i java`, `sdk i springboot`\r\n2. Create a POST multipart request with Insomnia for `http://localhost:8080/upload-file`, add some `file` and add `metadata` with the following content: \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"description\": \"Some description for my file\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Set JSON type for `metadata` part\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Image</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719646/147881161-8d5c913c-4f28-4317-9100-fdb99795a078.png)\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n3. Execute the request with Insomnia, it works and the return code is 200\r\n4. Copy and try to execute the curl command, the result will be:\r\n```shell\r\ncurl --request POST \\\r\n  --url http://localhost:8080/upload-file \\\r\n  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---011000010111000001101001' \\\r\n  --form 'metadata={\r\n\t\"description\": \"Some description for my file\"\r\n}' \\\r\n  --form file=@/Users/user/Documents/file.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it does not work, because the `;type=application/json` is missing for `metadata`\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n2021.7.2\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nMonterey 12.1\n\n### Installation method\n\nbrew install insomnia\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

Create a new collection\r\n2. Create a new GraphQL POST request with the following body: [graphql body.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630819/graphql.body.txt). Note that tabs seem to be important here, hence why I've added as a file to make sure it formats correctly.\r\n3. Add the following in the variables section: [variables.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630825/variables.txt)\r\n4. Export the collection\r\n5. Import the collection\r\n6. Look at the request inside the collection\r\n \n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nFrom what I can tell this appears to be a very specific problem with the formatting of the request. It only happens when the request body is being saved in double quotes, which is forced by the single quotes used inside the variables section.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be something about the way insomnia wraps the text onto a newline based on the body in a way that didn't previously happen. There are instances in the collection where we have a tab character split between two lines with the \"\\<newline>\" breaker between them.\r\n\r\nIn the exported collection, the line starts with `\\t` instead of `\\\\t` as you would expect (and it was previously). I have no idea why our \"real\" collection errors when the example one doesn't. But it seems likely that it has the same root cause, especially since I can see the same weird thing when looking directly at the yaml file.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm on a mac, but other members of the team have replicated on windows.\r\n\r\nExported example collection for reference:\r\n[insomnia.example.yaml.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630850/insomnia.example.yaml.txt)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv2022.3.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOs Monterey 12.3.1\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownloaded from insomnia.net\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nv2022.2.1",

	"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nIf I `copy as curl` a regular GET request with query paramters, the query parameters are URL Encoded as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl --request GET \\\r\n  --url 'http://google.com/?asdf=asdf%20asdf'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if I `copy as curl` a POST request with form url encoded paramters, the form parameters are **not** url encoded:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl --request POST \\\r\n  --url http://google.com/ \\\r\n  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\r\n  --data 'asdf=asdf asdf'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is inconsistent with the query parameter behavior and causes `copy as curl` to produce a different request than what Insomnia executes. When executing the request in Insomnia, the parameters are url encoded correctly as shown in the timeline.\r\n\r\nThe expected `copy as curl` output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl --request POST \\\r\n  --url http://google.com/ \\\r\n  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\r\n  --data 'asdf=asdf%20asdf'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create new request\r\n2. Change method to \"POST\"\r\n3. Change method to \"Form URL Encoded\"\r\n4. Add a form paramter that requires encoding\r\n5. View the timeline, Insomnia URL encodes correctly\r\n6. Copy as curl, the URL encoding is absent\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n* Insomnia's behavior matches the behavior of the \"copy as curl\" request\r\n* Form URL paramters are URL Encoded in \"copy as curl\"\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS 10.14.6\r\n - Installation Method: App\r\n - App Version v7.0.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNA",

	"[Environment Variables] Functions/Tags inside nested block referring to another Environment Variable do not render variable value",
	"<!--\r\nThank you for filing a bug report! 🐛 Please provide a short summary of the bug,\r\nalong with any information you feel relevant to replicating the bug.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot produce a minimal reproduction case (something that would work in\r\nisolation), please provide the steps or even link to a repository that causes\r\nthe problematic output to occur. \r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using Environment Variables, functions/tags inside a nested block referring to another Environment Variable that is constructed from an environment variable do not use the calculated variable value; instead the literal string is used. This only seems to impact functions, as direct references to these variables seem to still work.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to Base Environments\r\n1. Use this environment config:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"first_name\": \"Bobby\",\r\n  \"last_name\": \"'; DROP TABLES;'\",\r\n  \"full_name\": \"{{ _.first_name }} {{ _.last_name }}\",\r\n  \"baseEncodedRoot\": \"{% base64 'encode', 'normal', _.full_name %}\",\r\n  \"sub\": {\r\n    \"baseEncodedSub\": \"{% base64 'encode', 'normal', _.full_name %}\",\r\n    \"full_name\": \"{{_.full_name}}\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1. Mouse over both `_.baseEncodedRoot` and `_.sub.baseEncodedSub` tags and notice that they are both listed as having the same value.\r\n1. Click Done to exit the Manage Environments\r\n1. Create a new request\r\n1. Add two parameters:\r\n  * base64EncodedRootName={{ _.baseEncodedRoot }}\r\n  * base64EncodedSubName={{ _.sub.baseEncodedSub }}\r\n1. Click to preview/execute request\r\n1. Notice the values in the parameters are different\r\n1. Notice if you decode the base64 values, the root value is the calculated value (i.e., `Bobby '; DROP TABLES;'`; CORRECT), whereas the sub value is the literal string of the referenced value (i.e., `{{ _.first_name }} {{ _.last_name }}`; INCORRECT)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUsage of a tag/function that refers to another variable that is constructed from other variables should be the same whether it is on the root or nested in a block.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129673212-cde28656-9dd6-47bb-b074-e4c171878050.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129673289-fd1d6663-a559-4c2d-aebb-a0290047ab99.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129672830-69410a6b-a79c-46ac-999f-d9f30c0b6774.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. macOS 10.15.1]\r\n - Installation Method: [homebrew, built from source]\r\n - App Version: Insomnia 2021.4.1\r\nRelease date: 7/6/2021\r\nOS: Darwin x64 19.6.0\r\nElectron: 9.3.5\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nV8: 8.3.110.13-electron.0\r\nArchitecture: x64\r\nnode-libcurl: libcurl/7.73.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1k zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.9 zstd/1.4.9 libidn2/2.1.1 libssh2/1.9.0 nghttp2/1.42.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis was first discovered while using the Default Headers plugin to construct a header. After digging into things, I realized it wasn't an issue with the default headers plugin but has to do with the way the variables are being rendered outside the Manage Environments section.\r\n",

This is not what I expect / would like as it leads to a behaviour I can't fix as `a.proto` will be loaded, trying to include `common.proto`, except `protos/microservicea` was not added to import directory. It fails.\r\n\r\nIn Go and TS, we generate protos for each micro service including: \r\n- root directory path (aka `protos`) , but it doesn't import recursively protos\r\n- micro service path (aka `protos/microservicea`)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nSee description in Expected behaviour to reproduce the issue.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nMaybe a \"Add Import Directory\" (adding include path without importing protos) could solve the issue",

	"[WORKAROUND] Export/import is implemented as backup/restore and causes loss of data",
	"### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks the _Import from File_ button that is placed contextually in an empty collection, or, likewise, when the user navigates to a collection _Import/Export_ menu selection and selects _Import Data / From File_, this implies that data will be imported into the collection in the current context.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while importing, it's reasonable to expect that Insomnia would warn the user that the data being imported may overwrite parts of the existing collection and whether the user wants to do that, leave new data alone or just abort the import and sort it out manually before attempting another import.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe import functionality in most applications out there implies that some external data will be brought into the application or a different application area and adapted for the importing application or that area. \r\n\r\nInsomnia implements Export/Import as if it's a Backup/Restore and ignores contextually-placed import buttons and menus and uses various identifiers saved in the imported file to read data into the original collection. So, from the context, it appears that even though the pop-up said import was successful, nothing was imported.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, Insomnia reads data into the original collection without any regard to any modifications of that collection and silently wipes out existing data. Given that Insomnia follows the new trend of eliminating explicit load/save functionality, there is absolutely no way to preserve that lost data. It's just gone.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n* Create a test request collection `ABC`. Don't use any actual collections.\r\n* Add a couple of requests.\r\n* Export `ABC` as v4 YAML.\r\n* Rename `ABC` to `XYZ` in collection settings and edit collection description.\r\n* Create an empty collection `EMPTY`\r\n* Within `EMPTY`, click _Import from File_ and select exported YAML for `ABC`.\r\n* A pop-up is presented that the file was imported successfully and gives some stats.\r\n* The collection `EMPTY` remains empty, as if the import fails.\r\n* Switch to the dashboard.\r\n* `XYZ` was reverted to `ABC` by import and the new description and all request modifications are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThere's a recent issue for this and I apologize for creating this one, but I wanted to provide more context. If you want to close this one as a duplicate, I understand. Here it is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/4246\r\n\r\nThis issue was created as a result of this discussion with @develohpanda:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/4034#issuecomment-988302605\r\n\r\nThe least Insomnia can do is to compare time stamps and warn the user that the collection that is being restored from exported data has been modified after it was exported. This won't cost much development, but will give people a chance to learn that their data is about to be overwritten.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to keep current functionality, I suggest to rename it to Backup/Restore because it doesn't have much to do with Export/Import. If you choose to keep Export/Import, which would be desirable, imported data should be adapted for the collection into which it is being imported. This should include importing into other areas, such as importing into the Debug collection of a design document.\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2021.6.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Pro Version\t21H2 build 19044.1387\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nwebsite download\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",

PS the easiest way to get `spring` command is to install [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) and then install both Java and Spring Boot: `sdk i java`, `sdk i springboot`\r\n2. Create a POST multipart request with Insomnia for `http://localhost:8080/upload-file`, add some `file` and add `metadata` with the following content: \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"description\": \"Some description for my file\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3.

Execute the request with Insomnia, it works and the return code is 200\r\n4.

	"[WORKAROUND] Error when importing a YAML collection of a previously exported GraphQL request",
	"### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen importing a yaml file containing a collection there should be no error and the requests should contain the same body as the originally exported collection.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn our \"real\" insomnia collection we see an error saying that the import failed with a stack trace in the below example:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-05-05 at 12 34 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44771697/166915227-8ebad0e4-8408-4fd6-9b16-090c018f3901.png)\r\n\r\nWe have also created a test collection to try to reproduce the problem. While we haven't been able to see exactly the same issue, we do see an issue where the collection appears to import correctly, but when looking at the only request in the collection the GraphQL body and query variable sections are blank.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a new collection\r\n2. Create a new GraphQL POST request with the following body: [graphql body.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630819/graphql.body.txt). Note that tabs seem to be important here, hence why I've added as a file to make sure it formats correctly.\r\n3. Add the following in the variables section: [variables.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630825/variables.txt)\r\n4. Export the collection\r\n5. Import the collection\r\n6. Look at the request inside the collection\r\n \n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nFrom what I can tell this appears to be a very specific problem with the formatting of the request. It only happens when the request body is being saved in double quotes, which is forced by the single quotes used inside the variables section.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be something about the way insomnia wraps the text onto a newline based on the body in a way that didn't previously happen. There are instances in the collection where we have a tab character split between two lines with the \"\\<newline>\" breaker between them.\r\n\r\nIn the exported collection, the line starts with `\\t` instead of `\\\\t` as you would expect (and it was previously). I have no idea why our \"real\" collection errors when the example one doesn't. But it seems likely that it has the same root cause, especially since I can see the same weird thing when looking directly at the yaml file.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm on a mac, but other members of the team have replicated on windows.\r\n\r\nExported example collection for reference:\r\n[insomnia.example.yaml.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630850/insomnia.example.yaml.txt)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv2022.3.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOs Monterey 12.3.1\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownloaded from insomnia.net\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nv2022.2.1",
