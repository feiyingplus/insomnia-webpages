In particular, it appears like some kind of rounding in the order of ~15 ms is performed, and additionally that the response time is missing altogether sometimes (which may or may not be related).\r\n\r\nMy observations are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) When pinging the server, the roundtrip to the server is stable at 11-12 ms, with the occasional arbitrarily slower result. This seems reasonable.\r\n\r\n2) When repeatedly calling the endpoint through Chrome, the response time is stable around 16-17 ms, with the occasional arbitrarily slower result. This also seems reasonable, considering the additional overhead of HTTPS, the webserver, the API code, ...\r\n\r\n3) When repeatedly calling the endpoint through Insomnia, the response time is stable around 15-16 ms, but occasionally is either **0 ms** or **31 ms**. Never 1-14 ms, and never 17-30 ms. This does not seem reasonable. **0 ms** should be impossible given the 11-12 ms roundtrip to the server. Considering the **31 ms** results as well, it seems like there is some kind of rounding in the order of ~15 ms going on.",

Install default headers plugin\r\n2. Create a folder and set a default header:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"DEFAULT_HEADERS\": {\r\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer {{ _.token }}\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Create a request inside that folder, and add a Bearer authorization with a different token.\r\n4. Make a request -- the default header auth token is sent, not the request auth token.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI want the \"default headers\" to be just that: defaults. In other words, they are used only when they are not already explicitly set at a per-request level.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Installation Method: Flatpak\r\n - App Version: 2021.3.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe really really need a proper solution to re-using authorization settings.",

This only seems to impact functions, as direct references to these variables seem to still work.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to Base Environments\r\n1. Use this environment config:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"first_name\": \"Bobby\",\r\n  \"last_name\": \"'; DROP TABLES;'\",\r\n  \"full_name\": \"{{ _.first_name }} {{ _.last_name }}\",\r\n  \"baseEncodedRoot\": \"{% base64 'encode', 'normal', _.full_name %}\",\r\n  \"sub\": {\r\n    \"baseEncodedSub\": \"{% base64 'encode', 'normal', _.full_name %}\",\r\n    \"full_name\": \"{{_.full_name}}\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1. Mouse over both `_.baseEncodedRoot` and `_.sub.baseEncodedSub` tags and notice that they are both listed as having the same value.\r\n1. Click Done to exit the Manage Environments\r\n1. Create a new request\r\n1. Add two parameters:\r\n  * base64EncodedRootName={{ _.baseEncodedRoot }}\r\n  * base64EncodedSubName={{ _.sub.baseEncodedSub }}\r\n1. Click to preview/execute request\r\n1. Notice the values in the parameters are different\r\n1. Notice if you decode the base64 values, the root value is the calculated value (i.e., `Bobby '; DROP TABLES;'`; CORRECT), whereas the sub value is the literal string of the referenced value (i.e., `{{ _.first_name }} {{ _.last_name }}`; INCORRECT)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUsage of a tag/function that refers to another variable that is constructed from other variables should be the same whether it is on the root or nested in a block.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129673212-cde28656-9dd6-47bb-b074-e4c171878050.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129673289-fd1d6663-a559-4c2d-aebb-a0290047ab99.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30680/129672830-69410a6b-a79c-46ac-999f-d9f30c0b6774.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [e.g. macOS 10.15.1]\r\n - Installation Method: [homebrew, built from source]\r\n - App Version: Insomnia 2021.4.1\r\nRelease date: 7/6/2021\r\nOS: Darwin x64 19.6.0\r\nElectron: 9.3.5\r\nNode: 12.14.1\r\nV8: 8.3.110.13-electron.0\r\nArchitecture: x64\r\nnode-libcurl: libcurl/7.73.0 OpenSSL/1.1.1k zlib/1.2.11 brotli/1.0.9 zstd/1.4.9 libidn2/2.1.1 libssh2/1.9.0 nghttp2/1.42.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis was first discovered while using the Default Headers plugin to construct a header.

This is not what I expect / would like as it leads to a behaviour I can't fix as `a.proto` will be loaded, trying to include `common.proto`, except `protos/microservicea` was not added to import directory. It fails.\r\n\r\nIn Go and TS, we generate protos for each micro service including: \r\n- root directory path (aka `protos`) , but it doesn't import recursively protos\r\n- micro service path (aka `protos/microservicea`)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nSee description in Expected behaviour to reproduce the issue.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nMaybe a \"Add Import Directory\" (adding include path without importing protos) could solve the issue",

    "title": "[WORKAROUND] Export/import is implemented as backup/restore and causes loss of data",
    "body": "### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks the _Import from File_ button that is placed contextually in an empty collection, or, likewise, when the user navigates to a collection _Import/Export_ menu selection and selects _Import Data / From File_, this implies that data will be imported into the collection in the current context.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, while importing, it's reasonable to expect that Insomnia would warn the user that the data being imported may overwrite parts of the existing collection and whether the user wants to do that, leave new data alone or just abort the import and sort it out manually before attempting another import.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe import functionality in most applications out there implies that some external data will be brought into the application or a different application area and adapted for the importing application or that area. \r\n\r\nInsomnia implements Export/Import as if it's a Backup/Restore and ignores contextually-placed import buttons and menus and uses various identifiers saved in the imported file to read data into the original collection. So, from the context, it appears that even though the pop-up said import was successful, nothing was imported.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, Insomnia reads data into the original collection without any regard to any modifications of that collection and silently wipes out existing data. Given that Insomnia follows the new trend of eliminating explicit load/save functionality, there is absolutely no way to preserve that lost data. It's just gone.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n* Create a test request collection `ABC`. Don't use any actual collections.\r\n* Add a couple of requests.\r\n* Export `ABC` as v4 YAML.\r\n* Rename `ABC` to `XYZ` in collection settings and edit collection description.\r\n* Create an empty collection `EMPTY`\r\n* Within `EMPTY`, click _Import from File_ and select exported YAML for `ABC`.\r\n* A pop-up is presented that the file was imported successfully and gives some stats.\r\n* The collection `EMPTY` remains empty, as if the import fails.\r\n* Switch to the dashboard.\r\n* `XYZ` was reverted to `ABC` by import and the new description and all request modifications are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThere's a recent issue for this and I apologize for creating this one, but I wanted to provide more context. If you want to close this one as a duplicate, I understand. Here it is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/4246\r\n\r\nThis issue was created as a result of this discussion with @develohpanda:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/4034#issuecomment-988302605\r\n\r\nThe least Insomnia can do is to compare time stamps and warn the user that the collection that is being restored from exported data has been modified after it was exported. This won't cost much development, but will give people a chance to learn that their data is about to be overwritten.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to keep current functionality, I suggest to rename it to Backup/Restore because it doesn't have much to do with Export/Import. If you choose to keep Export/Import, which would be desirable, imported data should be adapted for the collection into which it is being imported. This should include importing into other areas, such as importing into the Debug collection of a design document.\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2021.6.0\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Pro Version\t21H2 build 19044.1387\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nwebsite download\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\ncurl command to include `;type=application/json` for metadata part\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe `;type=application/json` is missing and generated curl does not send a valid request.\r\nThe server responds:\r\n> Resolved [org.springframework.web.HttpMediaTypeNotSupportedException: Content type 'application/octet-stream' not supported]\r\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n0. Consider the following simple http handler (since I am a Java developer, the example is based on Spring Boot), the `App.groovy`:\r\n```groovy\r\nimport groovy.transform.ToString\r\nimport org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile;\r\n\r\n@RestController\r\nclass WebApplication {\r\n    @PostMapping(path = \"/upload-file\", consumes = \"multipart/form-data\")\r\n    String home(@RequestPart MultipartFile file, @RequestPart FileUploadMetadata metadata) {\r\n        println(metadata)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@ToString\r\nclass FileUploadMetadata {\r\n    String description\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt expects multipart POST request of 2 parts:\r\n- the `file` itself\r\n- and some json-formatted `metadata` with `description` field (as an example)\r\n\r\n1. run the server app with `spring run App.groovy`. PS the easiest way to get `spring` command is to install [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) and then install both Java and Spring Boot: `sdk i java`, `sdk i springboot`\r\n2. Create a POST multipart request with Insomnia for `http://localhost:8080/upload-file`, add some `file` and add `metadata` with the following content: \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"description\": \"Some description for my file\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Set JSON type for `metadata` part\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Image</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1719646/147881161-8d5c913c-4f28-4317-9100-fdb99795a078.png)\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n3. Execute the request with Insomnia, it works and the return code is 200\r\n4. Copy and try to execute the curl command, the result will be:\r\n```shell\r\ncurl --request POST \\\r\n  --url http://localhost:8080/upload-file \\\r\n  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---011000010111000001101001' \\\r\n  --form 'metadata={\r\n\t\"description\": \"Some description for my file\"\r\n}' \\\r\n  --form file=@/Users/user/Documents/file.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it does not work, because the `;type=application/json` is missing for `metadata`\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n2021.7.2\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nMonterey 12.1\n\n### Installation method\n\nbrew install insomnia\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

    "title": "[WORKAROUND] Error when importing a YAML collection of a previously exported GraphQL request",
    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen importing a yaml file containing a collection there should be no error and the requests should contain the same body as the originally exported collection.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn our \"real\" insomnia collection we see an error saying that the import failed with a stack trace in the below example:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-05-05 at 12 34 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44771697/166915227-8ebad0e4-8408-4fd6-9b16-090c018f3901.png)\r\n\r\nWe have also created a test collection to try to reproduce the problem. While we haven't been able to see exactly the same issue, we do see an issue where the collection appears to import correctly, but when looking at the only request in the collection the GraphQL body and query variable sections are blank.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a new collection\r\n2. Create a new GraphQL POST request with the following body: [graphql body.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630819/graphql.body.txt). Note that tabs seem to be important here, hence why I've added as a file to make sure it formats correctly.\r\n3. Add the following in the variables section: [variables.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630825/variables.txt)\r\n4. Export the collection\r\n5. Import the collection\r\n6. Look at the request inside the collection\r\n \n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nFrom what I can tell this appears to be a very specific problem with the formatting of the request. It only happens when the request body is being saved in double quotes, which is forced by the single quotes used inside the variables section.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be something about the way insomnia wraps the text onto a newline based on the body in a way that didn't previously happen. There are instances in the collection where we have a tab character split between two lines with the \"\\<newline>\" breaker between them.\r\n\r\nIn the exported collection, the line starts with `\\t` instead of `\\\\t` as you would expect (and it was previously). I have no idea why our \"real\" collection errors when the example one doesn't. But it seems likely that it has the same root cause, especially since I can see the same weird thing when looking directly at the yaml file.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm on a mac, but other members of the team have replicated on windows.\r\n\r\nExported example collection for reference:\r\n[insomnia.example.yaml.txt](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/files/8630850/insomnia.example.yaml.txt)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv2022.3.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOs Monterey 12.3.1\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownloaded from insomnia.net\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nv2022.2.1",

This format of URL is used for convenience as I run a lot of localhost apps at the same time and this is a nicer alternative than having each app run on a different port.\r\n\r\nI'm unable to reach these applications through insomnia without manually adding records for the specific app to my localhost.\r\n\r\nThis is the same issue as https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/4445 except I'm not using MacOS so I can't be sure if the cause is the same. I don't even know if MacOS uses systemd-resolved. If this should be one issue then please close this and add the details I've found about the problem to that ticket.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nError: Couldn't resolve host name\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n- On a linux machine using systemd-resolved, which is almost every modern distribution. Host a simple nginx hello world app. \r\n- Access it through your browser to test it's working \"http://anythingyoulike.localhost\"\r\n- Run a GET request against \"http://whateveryouwant.localhost\" and observe the \"Error: Couldn't resolve host name\"\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n2022.3.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nUbuntu\n\n### Operating System Version\n\n20.04.4 LTS x86_64\n\n### Installation method\n\napt\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

Make a request. Look at the cookie header value in Timeline tab.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI believe the error is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/bbceb6097c855f93f93b69c85af680d85ae0ac57/packages/insomnia/src/main/network/libcurl-promise.ts#L195-L197\r\n\r\nUnfortunately curl won't add multiple cookies like this. It wants the entire cookie string. From the [man docs on cookie](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html).\r\n\r\n>  The data should be in the format \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\r\n\r\nSo I can probably hack around this issue by carefully constructing the \"name\" here.\r\n\r\nI think it's worth mentioning that my particular use case would be much easier to handle if I could actually pass an arbitrary string value to the curl command for `--cookie`. I'd like to take advantage of setting an file name here:\r\n\r\n> If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated as a filename\r\n\r\nHowever this may be a can of curl worms you don't want to open.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n2022.4.2\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Monterey Version 12.4\n\n### Installation method\n\ndownload from insomnia\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n**This is a pre-emptive Issue made by the Insomnia team to document a known edge case with Team Sync**\r\n\r\nIf you are using Team Sync, you may experience synced Websocket requests mysteriously disappearing from Team Sync collections between syncing updates between different members of a team.  This is because WebSocket support is only available on Insomnia versions >= 2022.6.0.   If there are people on your Insomnia team who are not using an Insomnia version compatible with WebSocket Support, then the pull of a synced WebSocket Request will not be registered in their local Insomnia data system.  Thus, when they edit the collection and push it up via sync, this will rewrite the collection to not have the previously synced WebSocket request.  \r\n\r\nThis issue also exists for gRPC request \r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n**To avoid this behavior**, we (the Insomnia Team) recommend that all members of a team using Sync be on the latest version of Insomnia.  You can do so by going into your Insomnia preferences page and in the Software updates section clicking on \"Check now\"\r\n\r\nWe recommend setting your Software Update settings to \"Automatically download and install updates\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"955\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-09-27 at 8 13 43 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12381507/192566102-9c500388-8f02-42d9-a5e5-58edc9c79b02.png\">\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2022.5.5\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nMacOS Monterrey\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nDownload via Insomnia.rest\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n2022.6.0",

    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nIf I set an http network proxy on my Insomnia preferences I want all my requests to go through that proxy, including ws/wss connections.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nEven though I have a proxy configured, WebSocket requests are not going though that proxy. All other normal http/https requests do go through the proxy.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a new WebSocket request\r\n2. Test it without any proxy settings, verify it works\r\n3. Configure a proxy under Insomnia preferences\r\n4. Try to make a connection with that same WebSocket request, observe that the request still works but it does not go through the proxy\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe proxy in question is [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) which I use regularly to capture and analyse traffic. I am able to observe all other http/https requests I make from Insomnia on the mitmproxy interface, but not the ws/wss connections.\r\nI do see ws/wss connections made by my application on the mitmproxy interface.\r\nIf I turn the mitmproxy off but leave the proxy settings configured on Insomnia, the WebSocket request still works (meaning is not going through the proxy) but all other http/https requests wouldn't work, as expected.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n2022.6.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Ventura 13.1\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload from Insomnia website\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nPrior to version 2022.7.0 users could select which GraphQL operation to send by simply placing the mouse cursor anywhere on the query in question. With version 2022.7.0 this functionality is no longer available. Now users have to select the query from a dropdown.\r\n\r\nFirst, even though multiple bugs have been fixed in version 2022.7.1 the dropdown box still has problems. See attached image (this happens when going from multiple queries to one query without a name).\r\n![operation-name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6221648/211699857-151443bb-40b9-426b-b941-056e5f0c5cdc.JPG)\r\n\r\nBut second, more importantly, this is a huge regression, or at least a huge lack of functionality that existed prior. Consider that usually the mouse is already on the query the user is editing. Thus sending the query used to be just one click away. Now it usually takes me 3 or 4 clicks.\r\n\r\nWhile this may seem like a trivial change at first, for those of us who work with a document containing dozens of queries it's a blocker. I had to downgrade to version 2022.6.0.\r\n\r\nSome of this is of course muscle memory from previous functionality but consider:\r\n1) If you have many similar named queries, it takes much longer to correlate the queries with the names in the dropdown.\r\n2) If you have many queries with similar functionality, and you chose the neighboring query from the dropdown menu, you may not notice that the results are wrong.\r\n3) Muscle memory: I loved that Insomnia was the only client that had this ability, and now it's hard to go without it.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nUsers have to select the specific query they have to run from the Operations drop-down menu.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n_No response_\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThere was an issue raised for this: https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/5631 but it is now closed.

So if you prefer to have your collections in alphabetical order, you have to sort them anew every time you open the project view.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Open Insomnia in a project that has multiple files (collections, documents, etc.)\r\n2. Click the \u2195\ufe0f button and select a sorting mode (_Name Ascending (A-Z)_, for example)\r\n3.

When debugging within an Insomnia design document, if such a example path parameter value is provided, it should be added to the path of the url.\r\n\r\nThis behavior would be more useful when defining OpenAPI documents that can then be shared amongst a development team, without having to rely on values being stored within insomnia environment variables. \r\n\r\nThis behavior would also match how the OpenAPI `Try it out` functionality uses such example path values, as can be seen on the right of the below screenshot:\r\n\r\n![Path-param-example01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19207995/234921806-d7100417-603c-453f-b1b6-01417f6ff5a7.png)\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe Insomnia design document debug screen treats path parameters as Insomnia environment variables, and ignores any example path parameter values that are specified in the corresponding OpenAPI document.

Try to call the GET request\r\n2. Detect the use of `response` and therefore trigger a call to the POST, correctly using \"v2\" for \"version\", as specified in the sub environment.\r\n3. This call to POST succeeding\r\n4. The GET request then running as successfully using the \"id\" value from the preceding POST call.    \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInso CLI gives an error:\r\n```\r\n\u279c  inso-env-bug git:(main) inso run test inso-env-bug.yaml --env \"Test Sub Env\"\r\nNo workspace parentId found for wrk_a2965cc67d854a459dbe992a313ad01b setting default proj_default-project\r\n\r\n  Get Pet Test\r\n    1) Get Added Pet\r\n\r\n  0 passing (57ms)\r\n  1 failing\r\n\r\n  1) Get Pet Test\r\n       Get Added Pet:\r\n     Error: Failed to render request: req_334743dcff54449b92a1d3fd6f5e0ca2\r\n      at tryToInterpolateRequest (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-send-request/dist/index.js)\r\n      at async Insomnia.sendRequest (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-send-request/dist/index.js)\r\n      at async Insomnia.send (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-testing/dist/run/insomnia.js)\r\n      at async Context.<anonymous> (/private/var/folders/0p/dr_g40153lzbdph_lq0m4llc0000gn/T/insomnia-testing/0.7311933535869273-test.ts:10:23)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Insomnia 2023.2.0 the test suite runs as expected, correctly calling the POST request and then the GET request. \r\n\r\nI have looked into this in a little more detail and it appears the issue is that the POST request, which is triggered by the GET request, is failing to be rendered because when it tries to resolve `_.version` it returns null or undefined. This appears to be because it is only using values from the base environment, not the specified sub environment.\r\n\r\nIf I add `{ \"version\": \"v2\" }` to the base environment, the CLI call completes with no errors.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/finlaycurran/inso-env-bug\r\n2. `cd` into it\r\n3.

However, according to the readme, upstreams should be generated even when there is only 1 server (this is relevant because the behaviour of having an upstream versus a hardcoded host name for Kong is different).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (hasUpstreams(api)) {\r\n      document.upstreams = generateUpstreams(api, tags);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2023.5.6\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nDarwin Kernel Version 22.3.0\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nhomebrew\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Set up GitHub authentication and cloud sync. All my (previously local) collections are now in a project named \"Insomnia\" under the workspace \"Personal workspace\". The project type is shown as \"Secure Cloud\" in the project settings.\r\n\r\nOn my other Mac or Windows machines, I see multiple copies of the \"Insomnia\" project, but none have any contents.\r\n\r\nAttempts to change the project name (to see if syncing is working at all) aren't reflected on other computers.\r\n\r\nI next manually exported the collections for that project to a JSON file and transferred them to the new machine. I created a new project on that machine and imported the collections (which worked). All machines see the new project, but it still appears empty.\r\n\r\nThe dashboard on the Insomnia website shows 11 projects, 29 files and 1 collaborator, but when logging in on my other Mac, I see the 11 projects, but none contain any files.\r\n\r\nI have tried deleting the contents of the `~/Application Support/Insomnia` folder, and neither of the logs in the `~/Logs/Insomnia` folder show any errors.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nAs far as I can tell, there's no way to trigger a sync inside the UI itself, so I have no idea if a sync is being performed (I've been restarting Insomnia to try to trigger a forced download). It would be really helpful to see some visual indication that syncing has been performed, and a \"Sync now\" or \"Refresh\" function somewhere to trigger an attempted cloud sync.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n8.4.2\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Sonoma 14.1.1 (23B81) and Windows 11 v22H2 (Build 22621.2428)\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload from Insomnia.rest website\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nAs far as I can tell, cloud sync has never worked properly for me.",

    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\n1. The app can store sensitive information in encrypted cookies on the user's filesystem.\r\n2. The app can verify all IPC message senders before responding to them.\r\n3. The app can prevent reload of a window when handling navigation to the `appUrl`.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n1. The app uses local storage in an unencrypted manner.\r\n2. The app does not verify `event.sender` on all IPC messages.\r\n3. The app `return`s from `will-navigate` if the navigation is to `appUrl` but does not `preventDefault()`.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nThank you for designing the Insomnia Desktop Application and for making its source code available. The app does a great job of handling in-app navigation and following secure practices. We list a few pointers that can help make the app more secure.\r\n\r\n1. [Encrypting Cookies] The app currently stores sensitive information, including secret key, etc. in local storage. It will be beneficial to use cookies for the same and to encrypt them on the file system using Electron\u2019s fuses. [[Link](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses#cookieencryption)]\r\n2. [IPC Verification] Since the app currently uses custom IPC (e.g., for Socket Handlers [[Ref](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/a5d843171a841b9117e2e4b1503a362fca6bcfd0/packages/insomnia/src/main/network/websocket.ts#L497)]), it may be helpful to integrate sender verification `event.sender` throughout before handling IPC messages in the main process. [[Link](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages)]\r\n3. [Preventing Reloads] The current event handler on \u2018will-navigate\u2019 simply returns if the URL matches the `appUrl` [[Ref](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/a5d843171a841b9117e2e4b1503a362fca6bcfd0/packages/insomnia/src/main/window-utils.ts#L106)].

Without changing the filter, create a new request (e.g. HTTP)\r\n3.

So I like to keep the list in the left panel somewhat filtered down permanently depending on what I need to see - because otherwise there is a general performance impact due to it having to display so many items in the list all the time.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for the meantime whenever this happens is to simply type an extra character into the filter field then delete that character, triggering the filter to reapply as a result of changed input.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n8.6.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Sonoma 14.3.1 (23D60)\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownloaded from official insomnia.rest website\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

    "title": "Unable to View Response When Server Returns Incorrect Content-Encoding Header",
    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nFor a better user experience, it would be beneficial if the behavior is changed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. At the end of the error message, show the server's response, such as 'UTF-8' header returned by the server is incorrect. This allows users to understand more clearly why Insomnia considers it an error.\r\n2. Instead of treating header parsing failure as an error, display it as a warning and perform a fallback action by automatically detecting and decoding the encoding to UTF-8, then show the response.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nServers often return technically incorrect Content-Encoding headers. The server I'm testing does the same, returning Content-Encoding header with the value UTF-8. Upon further investigation, I found a question on SO that matches my situation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17154967/is-content-encoding-being-set-to-utf-8-invalid\r\n\r\nBoth Chrome web browser and cURL command show the response correctly in such cases. However, Insomnia only shows an error: `Error: Unrecognized or bad HTTP Content or Transfer-Encoding`.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. In Insomnia, you send a GET request to http://openapi.seoul.go.kr:8088/sample/xml/TbAdpWaitAnimalView/1/5/\r\n2. You confirm that an error occurs.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv8.6.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS 14.3.1(23D60)\n\n### Installation method\n\nI can't remember.\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

    "title": "Plugin Template Tag runs on sync",
    "body": "### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI don't expect to Template Tag to run during sync.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI have the 1Password plugin installed to fetch my secrets from the 1Password vault. The plugin is a Template Tag that I used in the Environments. When doing a request the Tag will run and fetch the 1Password secrets before first requesting me to authorise (1Password prompt).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-11 at 09 39 48](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/assets/657797/a0aaf107-b9d0-4810-bca6-752b49bc53cc)\r\n\r\nInsomnia does some syncing every minute ([here](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/blob/75c6a94ae99f9cfbbba8da0e817228e75454d03e/packages/insomnia/src/ui/components/dropdowns/sync-dropdown.tsx#L55-L60)). When this sync happens the Template Tag run method is also triggered. That means that when Insomnia is running (even in the background) I will get a 1Password prompt because it tries to fetch the secret in the run method. This is not very handy.\r\n\r\nThe plugin already caches the secret for 1 hour so the prompt only appears once per hour (Insomnia is always running). But getting the prompt every hour is still not plesant.\r\n\r\n**I do wonder why the Template Tag run method is triggered for the sync. And if it can be disabled or prevented.

    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nIf I change accounts when using OAuth 2.0 authentication, I expect all of the requests in that folder to use the new account. But unfortunately, requests use the stale (previous) OAuth 2.0 Token after clearing OAuth 2 session and clearing and retrieving a new token with a different account. \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nI am using Insomnia in scratch pad mode. I have a folder set up with OAuth 2.0 authentication. The requests inside the folder are set to inherit auth from parent. Unfortunately, when the parent folder has a new account authenticated, the underlying requests never use the new account. \n\nI've tried \"Clear OAuth 2 session\" as well as \"Clear\" and \"Refresh Token\" on the OAuth 2 tab. I've also tried all of these after rebooting the application. The requests will continue to use the old account even though the new JWT access token on the OAuth 2 tab on the folder clearly shows that new account that it should be using. \n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. In Scratch Pad mode, create a folder with OAuth 2.0 authentication with at least one request in it. \n2. Authenticate with an account and run your request, checking that the account is the correct one. \n3. Go back and login with a different account at the folder level. \n4.

    "body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nA POST request containing a file in its body, formatted as multipart/form-data, is sent to the FastAPI server in a loop exceeding 100 iterations. The server, adhering to its default configuration, issues a redirect with a 307 status code to the same path, albeit without a trailing slash. Following this redirect, the request is expected to be successfully processed and returned.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen executed in a loop, after approximately 20\u201325 iterations, the server issues a redirect with a 307 status code; however, it ceases to receive any further requests from Insomnia. Meanwhile, Insomnia either halts at this iteration, continuously incrementing the execution time as if awaiting a prolonged server response, or displays an error dialog, as depicted in the screenshot provided below.\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57741f01-12a0-4d3c-a47b-a3a81ca942aa)\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nTo reproduce the issue, it is sufficient to create a minimal FastAPI server where a function accepts a file and simply returns a response and send multiple requests to it in a loop.\n```python\nimport uvicorn\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.post(\"/uploadfile/\")\nasync def upload_handler(file: UploadFile):\n    return {\"filename\": file.filename}\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(\"main:app\", host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000, reload=False)\n```\n\nAs I said, file in the requests body must be in Multipart/form-data format.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\nNotably, Insomnia does not freeze when sending a single request or when sending requests in a loop to the correct path that does not trigger a redirect. However, in such cases, the error dialog mentioned earlier appears upon completion of the loop. Additionally, I have confirmed that the server is functioning correctly and the issue does not originate from its side, as identical operations in Postman execute seamlessly without any problems.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n10.3.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11 LTSC 2H24\n\n### Installation method\n\ndownloaded from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

Visit a site that returns a 307 response with a `location` header of a different domain and a `set-cookie` header without a `domain` attribute (my test endpoints do not include a `domain` attribute in the cookie response so maybe that is related, I have not tested when a `domain` is included)\n3.

    "body": "## Expected Behavior\n\n### **Description:**\n\nWhen receiving a JSON response containing large floating-point numbers (e.g., 99999999999999.99), Insomnia v11.0.0 modifies the values in two ways:\n\n### **Incorrect Rounding:**\n\n`99999999999999.99` \u2192 Rounds to `99999999999999.98` (precision error)\n\n### **Dropping Decimal Part:**\n\n`999999999999999.99` \u2192 Truncates to `1000000000000000` (decimal places lost completely)\nThis issue did not occur in previous versions of Insomnia (e.g., v2023.4.0.).\n\n\n### **Expected Result (Correct Values):**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"values\": [\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 99999999999999.99,  // Exact value\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 999999999999999.99,  // Exact value (no truncation)\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n### **Actual Result (Bug Manifestations):**\n\n#### **Case 1: Incorrect Rounding**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"sum\": {\n        \"amount\": 99999999999999.98,  // Rounded down incorrectly\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### **Case 2: Decimal Part Dropped**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"sum\": {\n        \"amount\": 1000000000000000,  // Decimal part (.99) removed\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n### **Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Prepare a mock API endpoint that returns the following JSON response (or configure your backend to return it):\n\n```json\n{\n    \"values\": [\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 99999999999999.99,\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"sum\": {\n                \"amount\": 999999999999999.99,\n                \"currency\": \"USD\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n_(This can be done using tools like json-server, mockoon, or a real backend endpoint.)_\n\n2. Send a GET/POST request to this endpoint using Insomnia v11.0.0.\n\n3. Observe the response in Insomnia:    \n    - The first amount (`99999999999999.99`) may display as `99999999999999.98`.\n    - The second amount (`999999999999999.99`) may display as `1000000000000000` (losing the decimal part). \n    \n4. Compare with other tools:\n    - Verify the same request in Insomnia v2023.4.0., curl, or Postman to confirm the correct values are returned.\n\n\n### _Root Cause:_\n\n### _Likely related to:_\n\n- JavaScript\u2019s number precision limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 2^53 - 1).\n- New JSON parser in Insomnia v11 mishandling large floats.\n\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [x] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Which sync method do you use?\n\n- [ ] Git sync.\n- [ ] Insomnia Cloud sync.\n- [x] Local only\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\nv11.0.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.3.2 \n\n### Installation method\n\ndownload from insomnia\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nv2023.4.0.",

There's no default name in the component, so it populates with blanks which then get collapsed into one option.

That variable is lower-cased by default.  I think it should have been using originalContentType instead.\n\nFor the Select Part Dropdown, the selected item and list item text just needs a fallback if the part title is null.  Like: {selectedPart.title || `Part ${selectedPart.id + 1}`}\n\nI tested both of those fixes locally and it seems to work fine.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n11.0.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload from insomnia.rest\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",

First of all, thank you so much for the recent fix in [#8505](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues/8505) \u2014 the reduced file size when exporting individual requests is already a great improvement, and I really appreciate your responsiveness and support.\n\nI just wanted to share a small follow-up issue related to that fix. When exporting a single request, the resulting file still includes the names of all folders/directories, along with the \u201cdocs\u201d content from them.\n\nIn my case, I use the \u201cdocs\u201d section frequently to document internal details, headers, or ideas \u2014 so these additional entries end up exposing more information than necessary, even when I only want to export a specific request.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n11.0.1\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows_NT x64 10.0.22631\n\n### Installation method\n\nDownload + autoupdate\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n_No response_",
