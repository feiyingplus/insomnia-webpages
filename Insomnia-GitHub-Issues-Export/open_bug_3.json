When debugging within an Insomnia design document, if such a example path parameter value is provided, it should be added to the path of the url.\r\n\r\nThis behavior would be more useful when defining OpenAPI documents that can then be shared amongst a development team, without having to rely on values being stored within insomnia environment variables. \r\n\r\nThis behavior would also match how the OpenAPI `Try it out` functionality uses such example path values, as can be seen on the right of the below screenshot:\r\n\r\n![Path-param-example01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19207995/234921806-d7100417-603c-453f-b1b6-01417f6ff5a7.png)\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe Insomnia design document debug screen treats path parameters as Insomnia environment variables, and ignores any example path parameter values that are specified in the corresponding OpenAPI document.

		"body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nThe Inso CLI should behave the same as the Insomia client and successfully run dependent requests which use environment variables only present in a selected sub environment.\r\n\r\nI have set up a repository for reproducing the issue: https://github.com/finlaycurran/inso-env-bug\r\n\r\nIt sets up two requests, an environment, and test suite as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST https://petstore.swagger.io/{{_.version}}/pet\r\nGET https://petstore.swagger.io/{{_.version}}/pet/{% response 'body', 'req_6758d4d7e56b445485d0832034d613f7', 'b64::JC5pZA==::46b', 'no-history', 60 %}\r\n(where the request referenced from the GET is the POST request)\r\n```\r\nBase Env: \r\n```\r\n{}\r\n```\r\nTest Sub Env:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"version\": \"v2\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA single test suite with one test calling the GET request above, and checking for 200 response. \r\n\r\nI would expect that calling `inso run test inso-env-bug.yaml --env \"Test Sub Env\"` would:\r\n1. Try to call the GET request\r\n2. Detect the use of `response` and therefore trigger a call to the POST, correctly using \"v2\" for \"version\", as specified in the sub environment.\r\n3. This call to POST succeeding\r\n4. The GET request then running as successfully using the \"id\" value from the preceding POST call.    \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInso CLI gives an error:\r\n```\r\n➜  inso-env-bug git:(main) inso run test inso-env-bug.yaml --env \"Test Sub Env\"\r\nNo workspace parentId found for wrk_a2965cc67d854a459dbe992a313ad01b setting default proj_default-project\r\n\r\n  Get Pet Test\r\n    1) Get Added Pet\r\n\r\n  0 passing (57ms)\r\n  1 failing\r\n\r\n  1) Get Pet Test\r\n       Get Added Pet:\r\n     Error: Failed to render request: req_334743dcff54449b92a1d3fd6f5e0ca2\r\n      at tryToInterpolateRequest (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-send-request/dist/index.js)\r\n      at async Insomnia.sendRequest (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-send-request/dist/index.js)\r\n      at async Insomnia.send (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-testing/dist/run/insomnia.js)\r\n      at async Context.<anonymous> (/private/var/folders/0p/dr_g40153lzbdph_lq0m4llc0000gn/T/insomnia-testing/0.7311933535869273-test.ts:10:23)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Insomnia 2023.2.0 the test suite runs as expected, correctly calling the POST request and then the GET request. \r\n\r\nI have looked into this in a little more detail and it appears the issue is that the POST request, which is triggered by the GET request, is failing to be rendered because when it tries to resolve `_.version` it returns null or undefined. This appears to be because it is only using values from the base environment, not the specified sub environment.\r\n\r\nIf I add `{ \"version\": \"v2\" }` to the base environment, the CLI call completes with no errors.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/finlaycurran/inso-env-bug\r\n2. `cd` into it\r\n3. Run `inso run test inso-env-bug.yaml --env \"Test Sub Env\"`\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n3.14.0 and 2023.2.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Ventura Version 13.1 (22C65)\n\n### Installation method\n\nhomebrew.

		"body": "### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a modal opens, for example the environment editor, the screen reader should speak it opened.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen pressing CONTROL+E, the screen reader speaks nothing, and pressing tab gives the impression the modal didn't open, because it goes to the send button of the request. To access the modal, at present, it's necessary to press SHIFT+TAB various times or, a faster method, set the screen reader to browse mode instead of focus mode and pressing CONTROL+HOME.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. With Narrator or NVDA, open Insomnia.\r\n\r\n2. Press CONTROL+E to open for example the environments dialog. You will notice Narrator or NVDA won't speak.\r\n\r\n3. Press tab. It will go to the send button.\r\n\r\n4. To go to the modal, there are two options:\r\n\r\n- If Narrator or NVDA are in focus mode (most likely), toggle browse mode by pressing INSERT+SPACE. If you press CONTROL+HOME in browse mode, on narrator it will read the dialog contents.\r\nNVDA will speak \"dialog\" and will require to press space or ENTER on it to open, but this is a default NVDA behavior.\r\n\r\nI found issue #5494 that gave me the idea to test on Insomnia 2022.6.0, on this version NVDA or narrator speaks the modal correctly and doesn't require to manually open it with browse mode. Also tab cycles by the modal content instead of going to the request's send button on this version.\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nTested with [NVDA](https://nvaccess.org) version 2023.1.\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n2023.2.2\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nWindows 11 22H2\n\n### Installation method\n\nTested the installed version and running from latest develop branch.\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\n2022.6.0",

Instead, the server URL is directly loaded into the host in the Kong configuration file.\r\n\r\nI believe the issue is that the `hasUpstreams` function will only return true if more than 1 upstream is present. However, according to the readme, upstreams should be generated even when there is only 1 server (this is relevant because the behaviour of having an upstream versus a hardcoded host name for Kong is different).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (hasUpstreams(api)) {\r\n      document.upstreams = generateUpstreams(api, tags);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2023.5.6\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nDarwin Kernel Version 22.3.0\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nhomebrew\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",

When debugging within an Insomnia design document, if such a example path parameter value is provided, it should be added to the path of the url.\r\n\r\nThis behavior would be more useful when defining OpenAPI documents that can then be shared amongst a development team, without having to rely on values being stored within insomnia environment variables. \r\n\r\nThis behavior would also match how the OpenAPI `Try it out` functionality uses such example path values, as can be seen on the right of the below screenshot:\r\n\r\n![Path-param-example01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19207995/234921806-d7100417-603c-453f-b1b6-01417f6ff5a7.png)\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe Insomnia design document debug screen treats path parameters as Insomnia environment variables, and ignores any example path parameter values that are specified in the corresponding OpenAPI document.

The GET request then running as successfully using the \"id\" value from the preceding POST call.    \n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nInso CLI gives an error:\r\n```\r\n➜  inso-env-bug git:(main) inso run test inso-env-bug.yaml --env \"Test Sub Env\"\r\nNo workspace parentId found for wrk_a2965cc67d854a459dbe992a313ad01b setting default proj_default-project\r\n\r\n  Get Pet Test\r\n    1) Get Added Pet\r\n\r\n  0 passing (57ms)\r\n  1 failing\r\n\r\n  1) Get Pet Test\r\n       Get Added Pet:\r\n     Error: Failed to render request: req_334743dcff54449b92a1d3fd6f5e0ca2\r\n      at tryToInterpolateRequest (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-send-request/dist/index.js)\r\n      at async Insomnia.sendRequest (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-send-request/dist/index.js)\r\n      at async Insomnia.send (/snapshot/insomnia/packages/insomnia-testing/dist/run/insomnia.js)\r\n      at async Context.<anonymous> (/private/var/folders/0p/dr_g40153lzbdph_lq0m4llc0000gn/T/insomnia-testing/0.7311933535869273-test.ts:10:23)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Insomnia 2023.2.0 the test suite runs as expected, correctly calling the POST request and then the GET request. \r\n\r\nI have looked into this in a little more detail and it appears the issue is that the POST request, which is triggered by the GET request, is failing to be rendered because when it tries to resolve `_.version` it returns null or undefined. This appears to be because it is only using values from the base environment, not the specified sub environment.\r\n\r\nIf I add `{ \"version\": \"v2\" }` to the base environment, the CLI call completes with no errors.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/finlaycurran/inso-env-bug\r\n2. `cd` into it\r\n3. Run `inso run test inso-env-bug.yaml --env \"Test Sub Env\"`\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n3.14.0 and 2023.2.0\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nmacOS\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nmacOS Ventura Version 13.1 (22C65)\n\n### Installation method\n\nhomebrew.

	"### Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a modal opens, for example the environment editor, the screen reader should speak it opened.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nWhen pressing CONTROL+E, the screen reader speaks nothing, and pressing tab gives the impression the modal didn't open, because it goes to the send button of the request. To access the modal, at present, it's necessary to press SHIFT+TAB various times or, a faster method, set the screen reader to browse mode instead of focus mode and pressing CONTROL+HOME.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. With Narrator or NVDA, open Insomnia.\r\n\r\n2. Press CONTROL+E to open for example the environments dialog. You will notice Narrator or NVDA won't speak.\r\n\r\n3. Press tab. It will go to the send button.\r\n\r\n4. To go to the modal, there are two options:\r\n\r\n- If Narrator or NVDA are in focus mode (most likely), toggle browse mode by pressing INSERT+SPACE. If you press CONTROL+HOME in browse mode, on narrator it will read the dialog contents.\r\nNVDA will speak \"dialog\" and will require to press space or ENTER on it to open, but this is a default NVDA behavior.\r\n\r\nI found issue #5494 that gave me the idea to test on Insomnia 2022.6.0, on this version NVDA or narrator speaks the modal correctly and doesn't require to manually open it with browse mode.

Unfortunately, this is not possible since none of the variables can be resolved afterward.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nPostman uses the syntax `{{my-variable}}` to reference variables from the environment.

We have many different applications and each has their own set of credentials. So we usually have a client, secret, and scope for each application. We can setup the request chain for the first application, but when we try to create a second chain whenever we save the Edit Tag form the settings are not saved.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a query to obtain a token if you don't already have one\r\n2. Create a new environment\r\n3. Add two variables that are strings (Id/Pw or something) and a variable to hold the token\r\n4. Configure the token var to pull from a response body of of the token request\r\n5. Create a new environment and repeat steps 1-4\r\n6. Note that you cannot save the second request chain mapping\r\n\r\nI have tried both using the same auth query in step #1 and creating a new HTTP request to obtain the token and neither work. \r\n\r\nI opened the dev tools and saw these errors:\r\n\r\nWhen saving the Edit Tag modal:\r\n```\r\n12:49:51.060 › Error rendering template Template render error: (unknown path)\r\n  Error: No request specified\r\n    at Object._prettifyError (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:113:11)\r\n    at /Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:2743:19\r\n    at eval (eval at _compile (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:2806:18), <anonymous>:10:11)\r\n    at file:///Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/index-391c2d16.js:90:19130\r\nhelpers.ts:98 12:49:51.060 › Failed to render element Environment {% response 'body', '', '', 'never', 60 %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd after opening the Edit Tag modal again:\r\n```\r\n12:50:27.515 › Error rendering template Template render error: (unknown path)\r\n  Error: No request specified\r\n    at Object._prettifyError (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:113:11)\r\n    at /Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:2743:19\r\n    at eval (eval at _compile (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:2806:18), <anonymous>:10:11)\r\n    at file:///Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/index-391c2d16.js:90:19130\r\nhelpers.ts:98 12:50:27.516 › Failed to render element Environment {% response 'body', '', '', 'never', 60 %}\r\nhelpers.ts:98 12:50:27.518 › Error rendering template Template render error: (unknown path)\r\n  Error: No request specified\r\n    at Object._prettifyError (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:113:11)\r\n    at /Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:2743:19\r\n    at eval (eval at _compile (/Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/node_modules/nunjucks/browser/nunjucks.js:2806:18), <anonymous>:10:11)\r\n    at file:///Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/index-391c2d16.js:90:19130\r\nhelpers.ts:98 12:50:27.518 › Failed to render element  {% response 'body', '', '', 'never', 60 %}\r\n```\n\n### Is there an existing issue for this?\n\n- [X] I have searched the [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/Kong/insomnia/issues) for this problem.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nAt least two other people in our company is having the same issue. \r\n\r\nFull Insomnia info:\r\nVersion: Insomnia 2023.5.6\r\nBuild date: 8/22/2023\r\nOS: Darwin x64 22.4.0\r\nElectron: 25.2.0\r\nNode: 18.15.0\r\nNode ABI: 116\r\nV8: 11.4.183.23-electron.0\r\nArchitecture: x64\n\n### Insomnia Version\n\n2023.5.6\n\n### What operating system are you using?\n\nOther (specify below)\n\n### Operating System Version\n\nHappens on Mac and Windows\n\n### Installation method\n\ndownloaded\n\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\n\nA week or two ago (I've gotten several updates these past couple weeks)",

Instead, the server URL is directly loaded into the host in the Kong configuration file.\r\n\r\nI believe the issue is that the `hasUpstreams` function will only return true if more than 1 upstream is present. However, according to the readme, upstreams should be generated even when there is only 1 server (this is relevant because the behaviour of having an upstream versus a hardcoded host name for Kong is different).\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (hasUpstreams(api)) {\r\n      document.upstreams = generateUpstreams(api, tags);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Insomnia Version\r\n\r\n2023.5.6\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n### Operating System Version\r\n\r\nDarwin Kernel Version 22.3.0\r\n\r\n### Installation method\r\n\r\nhomebrew\r\n\r\n### Last Known Working Insomnia version\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Add another folder inside of the top folder and add like ten requests each with around ten query parameters to it. Duplicate the folder with those requests like 10 times.
